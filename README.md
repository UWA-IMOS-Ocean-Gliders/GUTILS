# ðŸš¤ Glider Utilities (GUTILS) for IMOS

> âš âš âš  This repo is a fork of the [GUTILS](https://github.com/SECOORA/GUTILS) project modified to suit the purposes of IMOS and our glider missions. 
> 
> For support with GUTILS outside the context of IMOS, please reach out to the upstream repo.

## Dev instructions

- The `main` branch in this repo is the GUTILS project adapted for the purposes of IMOS
- The `master` branch is synced with `upstream/master` (to stay consistent with their naming conventions)

When making contributions to the upstream repo, branch off `master` (make sure its synced with `upstream/master`) and make the edits, or cherry-pick commits onto the branch.
